## Course Description:

Introduction to methods and techniques of programming software in MATLAB to solve engineering problems. Includes coverage of MATLAB user environment and functions, engineering problems, engineering variables, advanced math (matrices), engineering solutions (plotting) and verification. Designed to train students in solving engineering problems with MATLAB software.

## Course Objectives:

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Use MATLAB to solve engineering problems
- Use MATLAB to plot engineering solutions
- Use MATLAB to verify engineering solutions
- Use MATLAB to solve engineering problems with matrices

## Final Project

The final project for this course was to create a MatLab app that did an action of our choosing. My app is a chatbot that uses the GPT-3 API to solve MatLab problems. The app is a simple GUI that allows the user to input a problem and get a solution. The app also formats the solution into a format that can be turned in to Canvas. The app is not perfect, but it does work with reasonable accuracy and is a good proof of concept. The biggest problem that I ran in to was hallucinations in the API. While not exhibited in the majority of the behavior, the api would sometimes produce responses that were confidently wrong. It is worth noting that this app was approved by the professor.
