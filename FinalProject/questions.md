## Making a quiz
Make a 5 question multiple choice quiz about matlab that asks students about making an app in matlab using the mat lab app designer.

## Linspace Example Assignment 10
In this problem you will replace the “loop method” of creating the x & y vectors used to plot the circle with an even better (faster) program.  Again, copy and paste your code into a new section for Problem 3, and then replace the loop with code to create the vectors using the linspace(_) function. You will see this is much easier, more efficient, and faster.  Better programming practice.

## Polygon Problem
Write a program in MATLAB that asks a user to input the number of sides of a polygon and creates a plot showing the polygon with the correct number of sides.  You can use your code you created in Assignment 10 and modify it for this assignment. (Hint: consider that the code you wrote to draw your circle doesn’t really draw a circle, but instead draws a “many-sided” polygon.  Use “if” statements to put the appropriate name of the polygon in the title of the plot (you can limit the number of available names in your code to however many you want, but you should name at least the 3-sided through the 6-sided polygons).  Use if statements &/or loops to be sure the user enters a positive integer for the number of sides. Set the center of your polygon to (0, 0) and set the axis limits to just bigger than the radius.  When I wrote my code, I set the center at (0, 0), set my radius to 10, and set my axis limits as:

“axis([-12 12 -12 12])”
